## Tools Used ##
Power BI: A business intelligence tool used to create dynamic visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized to develop advanced calculations and insights within the dashboard.



## Findings ##
SALES:
1)    Sales Growth Rate is negative at -2.38%, indicating a decline in overall revenue.

2)    Monthly total quantity sold shows fluctuation, with peaks in May (4,822 units) and July (4,755), then a drop in September (4,592).

3)    High sales are in Home Appliances (1.22M) and Beauty (1.14M) categories.

4)    Total sales by region are close, but Dar es Salaam (1.31M) and Kampala (1.31M) slightly lead.

5)    Out of stock issues persist, especially in Sony, L’Oreal, Apple, LG, and Nestle brands (1–2 out-of-stock incidents each).

6)    Categories like Beauty, Groceries, and Home Appliances have experienced stockouts.

7)    Inventory Turnover Rate is extremely low at 0.02, indicating slow-moving inventory or overstocking.

8)    Warehouse Utilization Rate Dar Central (92.94%) and Kampala Depot (91.76%) are near full.

9)    Mombasa Hub (75.36%) and Nairobi Main (52.87%) are under-utilized.

10)  Supplier on-time delivery rate is low at 49.4%, meaning over half of deliveries are late.

## Recommendation ##
#### Inventory Management:
Prioritize stocking only fast-moving products in high-utilization warehouses like Dar es Salaam (92.94%) and Kampala (91.76%).
Before restocking these locations, validate that existing inventory has been sold, using sales velocity data.
For slow-moving or seasonal products, direct stock to lower-utilized warehouses like Nairobi (52.87%) and Mombasa (75.36%) to reduce congestion and storage costs in key hubs.

#### Automate Reordering:
Set dynamic reorder points based on historical quantity sold and seasonality.

## Supplier Management
1)Monitor Lead Time per Supplier: Track average delivery time to anticipate delays.
2)Create a Supplier Scorecard: Evaluate suppliers monthly on:
                    On-time delivery %
                    Lead time trend
                    Fill rate

3)Negotiate or Replace Poor Performers: -Especially suppliers with consistent delays and poor metrics.

 ## Sales Performance Recovery
Boost Low-performing Categories: -Use bundles, cross-sell strategies, or seasonal discounts.
Targeted Marketing by Region and Segment: -Customize offers for regions like Nairobi and Mombasa to boost lagging sales.
Improve customer engagement- By marketing based on customer product preference and also encourage product reviews.
